# Tones

This is a tone generator that uses the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API). You can generate multiple sounds at any frequency, with the following wave forms:

- sine
- square
- triangle
- sawtooth

## NOTE: this only works in Chrome right now, no other browsers implement the Web Audio API yet.
